# Neuralautomaton
This Python script simulates and visualizes a 2D grid of simple "integrate-and-fire" neurons using the Pygame library for graphics and event handling, and the NumPy library for efficient numerical calculations. It creates a dynamic, evolving visual pattern based on the interactions between neighboring neurons.
